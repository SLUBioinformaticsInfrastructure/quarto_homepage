We are currently setting up a new shared solution for compute and storage at SLU, together with UPPMAX at Uppsala University, and SLU IT.

The aim is simple: to make it easier for SLU researchers to run analyses, handle large datasets, and store research data safely without having to set everything up on their own.

**What can you use it for?**

Through this collaboration, SLU researchers will get access to UPPMAX's compute system, Pelle, the data storage systems Gorilla and Lutra, designed for computation ready storage and long-term data storage, respectively.

**Affordable long-term storage with Lutra**

One key part of this project is Lutra long-term storage, which will be available at a clear and predictable cost:

500 SEK per TB per year

This includes copies on two different media in two locations (warm storage in Uppsala and tape storage in Linköping) and makes Lutra a cost-effective option for storing large amounts of research data, such as sequencing data, processed results, or archived project data.

**Opening soon for all SLU researchers**

Right now, the system is being set up and tested. Very soon, it will be open to everyone at SLU through a local application round.

**Help us test the system**

If you’re curious, we invite you to come and try it out:

- Apply for a project
- Run your analyses on Pelle
- Test long-term storage on Lutra
- Tell us what works well (and what doesn’t)

Your feedback will help us improve the service and make sure it fits research needs at SLU.
