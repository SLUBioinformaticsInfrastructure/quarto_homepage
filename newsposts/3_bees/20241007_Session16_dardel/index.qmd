We are thrilled to have Henric Zazzi join us for this session, where he will provide an introduction to the ”new” Dardel supercomputer, which will replace Uppmax for many of us in the coming year. Henric will give us an introduction to the system and walk us through how to log in and start using it, making this an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in high-performance computing or planning to work with Dardel in the future.
