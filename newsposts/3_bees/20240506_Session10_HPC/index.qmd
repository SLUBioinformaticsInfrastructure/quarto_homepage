Join us to learn the basics of high performance computing. We will have a brief overview of HPC facilities in Sweden, how to log in, and how to use the job queuing system, Slurm. We will also have a quick look at how to apply for projects on these clusters.

After a short lecture, we will show how to access Rackham from UPPMAX with Visual Studio Code. If you are new to using clusters, this session is for you!
