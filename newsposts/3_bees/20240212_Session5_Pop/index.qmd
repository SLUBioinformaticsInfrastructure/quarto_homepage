For the fifth session of the 3 Bâ€™s series, we cover some of the basics of population structure analyses in R. This will not be a lecture on the theory of population genetics, but rather how you can use R to create plots and make them ready for your publication.
 
**Preparation:** If you would like to prepare in advance, please have a look at this [vignette](http://127.0.0.1:19308/library/LEA/doc/LEA.R).
 
As always, you are most welcome to drop by and listen without participating.
 
**When:** Monday Feb 12, 09:45 \
**Where:** Campus Alnarp, Pisum (different room from the usual for Alnarp attendees)\
or via **[Zoom](https://slu-se.zoom.us/j/69486568642)** (Password: 410 410)
