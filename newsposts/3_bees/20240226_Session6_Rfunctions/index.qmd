For the sixth session of the 3 Bâ€™s series, we talk about how to write your own functions in R. Very handy of you want to wrap code you are using over and over again into a re-usable function!
 
**Preparation:** If you would like to prepare in advance, please have a look at this [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/write-functions-in-r/), and [see here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) for additional content.
 
As always, you are most welcome to drop by and listen without participating.
 
When: Monday Feb 26, 09:45\
Where: Campuse Alnarp, Vegetum, Red room (different room from the usual for Alnarp attendees)\
