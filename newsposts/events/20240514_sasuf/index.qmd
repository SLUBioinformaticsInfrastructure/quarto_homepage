Join us on the 14th of May to discover how open source tools can be used in process of describing plant-pathogen interactions. We will use browser and R-based tools to annotate genomes, perform functional annotation, and select genes that are important in both the process of a fungal pathogen infecting the plant, and the plant launching an immune response. 

We will use Cercospora and sugar beet as a model system, but the tools we will show can be applied to any plant-fungal patho-system.

We will also have a session in the afternoon with industry representatives where we will discuss how students and researchers can prepare themselves for a career move into industry, as well as how university-industry collaborations can be established and maintained.

Our session will be hosted in Alnarp, and you are welcome to join via Zoom. No prior bioinformatics knowledge is required for this workshop.
