Everyone interested in Bioinformatics was welcome to this meeting. We had short introductions from all participants when they presented briefly their field and what they were expecting from a Bioinformatics Infrastructure at SLU. The rest of the day was dedicated to brainstorming in groups and the participants discussed
- Teaching/training activities
- Organisation of the support
- Activities for the bioinformatics community
- Technical infrastructure organisation

All participants were invited to discuss at least 2 themes within an hour.
