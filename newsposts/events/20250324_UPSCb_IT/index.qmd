This meeting brings together different teams, including SLU Central IT, SLU Bioinformatics Infrastructure (SLUBI), and our colleagues from the [Ume√• Plant Science Centre (UPSC) Bioinformatics Facility](https://www.upsc.se/platforms/upsc-bioinformatics-facility.html). 

The goal is to learn how to use a tool called Kubernetes for managing computer resources and running nextflow pipelines. By working together, we want to to improve our bioinformatics services and support.
