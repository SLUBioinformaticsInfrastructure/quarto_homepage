The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop 2024 brought together researchers, students, and professionals from across Sweden to discuss recent developments in bioinformatics. The event was held at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and included keynote lectures, practical workshops, and networking activities.

The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop has been held annually since 2000, with hosting rotating among Swedish universities. It is the largest national meeting for bioinformaticians and computational biologists, providing a platform for exchange of research, methods, and experiences within the field.

SBW 2024 was the Swedish contribution to the Nordic CompBio Week 2024, a free hybrid bioinformatics conference in which participating Nordic countries organized local in-person programmes that were also streamed online.

In total, the workshop hosted 205 on-site participants, with 58 abstract and poster submissions. An additional 318 participants registered for online attendance, making SBW 2024 a hybrid event that engaged researchers across Sweden, the Nordic region, and internationally.

SLUBI organized this two-day conference as part of the organizing committee. We were proud to be able to showcase SLU, and research at SLU in the area of bioinformatics, to a national and international audience.
