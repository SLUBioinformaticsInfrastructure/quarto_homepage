This course is organised in collaboration with the [emPLANT master’s programme](https://emplant-master.eu/information-emplant-master-plant-breeding), a joint European MSc that brings together students and teachers from several universities with a focus on plant breeding and plant science.

The course focuses on practical bioinformatics skills relevant to plant science and breeding. It introduces key tools and workflows used for sequence analysis, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and reproducible research. Through short lectures and hands-on sessions, students will work with Linux, perform sequence homology searches, assess sequencing data quality, and explore basic genome comparisons.

We will be teaching along with other teachers from SLU and other institutions.
