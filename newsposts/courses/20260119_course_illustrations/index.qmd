Learn how to manage, visualize, and share data effectively using R, QGIS, and open science tools. This hands-on course combines theory with practical exercises to help you:

- Organize and update datasets efficiently.
- Create clear and meaningful visualizations and maps to communicate your data.
- Explore mapping techniques using vector and raster formats with GIS software.
- Train open science by making your work reproducible and shareable online.

Students will work with real datasets, collaborate in groups, and apply new skills in a final individual project. The course includes one intensive week on campus, followed by an independent project presented online.
