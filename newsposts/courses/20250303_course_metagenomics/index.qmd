This course focuses on multi-omics analyses of microbial communities, covering a range of topics from the history of OMICS to advanced techniques like metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and single-cell methods. It includes interactive sessions, flipped classrooms, and research visits to facilities like the National Genomics Infrastructure. 

We were happy to be part of this advanced course on all things metagenomics.
