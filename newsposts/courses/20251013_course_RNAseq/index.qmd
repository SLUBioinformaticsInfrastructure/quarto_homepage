High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies and in particular Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized the way we conduct gene expression analysis. In comparison to micro-array-based methods, NGS has unleashed an almost unlimited power to perform gene expression analysis, for a similar price and with faster, more comprehensive, more efficient and more reproducible characteristics. Rapidly, the data generation rate has exceeded the analytical capabilities and data analysis has become the major bottleneck in gene expression studies. 

The SLU Bioinformatics Infrastructure (SLUBI) is organizing two back-to-back courses for the Organism Biology Research School, aimed primarily at PhD students, that has the objective to help addressing this problem by (i) helping participants critically assess the challenges faced in the HTS field, (ii) developing efficient communication skill with bioinformatician, and (iii) training students in analyzing HTS data. For detailed info about the courses, please see the syllabus and preliminary schedule attached.

The aims of the courses are to:

- familiarize the participants with advanced RNA-Seq data analysis methodologies and how biological knowledge can be gained from these by illustrating different analyses approaches

- allow the participants to acquire computational competences about latest RNA-Seq analytical approaches and related statistical methods

- expose the participants to modern computing technologies, as the computer hands-on of the course will be performed using cloud computing resources

- develop the participantsâ€™ awareness to critically reflect onto RNA-Seq analysis strengths and weaknesses

- enable participants to perform the analysis of their own data (in stance of the exemplary dataset otherwise available) (course II)

The second course is a follow-up for attendees to apply the knowledge gained from the first course on their own data. 

The courses will be conducted online only. However, if students wish so, they can organise themselves in groups and join using one of the teaching facilities available at SLU.

The maximum number of participants is 20. PhD students will be prioritised, but admission will be on a first-come, first-served basis, provided that the minimal requirements are met. Application deadline: September 13th.
