This course provides a solid introduction to bioinformatics, focusing on essential methods and tools for analyzing DNA sequences and protein structures. 

Students will learn how to:

- Work with biological databases and compare genetic and protein data.

- Use software such as EMBOSS, UGENE, and R for sequence and statistical analyses.

- Work in a High Performance Cluster Unix/Linux environment, as well as apply web-based bioinformatics tools.

- Understand key bioinformatics concepts including phylogeny, comparative and functional genomics, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).

By the end of the course, students will be able to apply basic bioinformatics techniques, interpret analytical results, and set up their own bioinformatics toolkit using publicly available resources.
