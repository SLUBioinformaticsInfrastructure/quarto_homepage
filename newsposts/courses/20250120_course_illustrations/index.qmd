A course on how to assess and visualize data using R, including creating suitable graphs and multi-panel figures for publications and presentations. We cover the use of GIS software to map data points with geographical and cultural elements. Additionally, the course includes merging and updating datasets in R and planning for code and raw data submission.

We were happy to be part of this GS-VMAS course, lead by [Peter Halvarsson](https://www.slu.se/en/ew-cv/peter-halvarsson/).
