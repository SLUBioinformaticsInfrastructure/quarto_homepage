    "text": "Applying for projects at HPC2N\nHere is the link to the official documentation on how to get access to HPC2N. If you don’t have an account at HPC2N, you need to be added to an existing project, or apply for a project then request an account.\nThe following is a small rundown of this information based on our experience.\nMore often than not, small compute and small storage projects are enough for the bioinformatics projects we see at SLU. You must apply for a storage project alongside a compute project if you are planning to do any analyses.\nThe administrators at NAISS approve projects at least once a week, but often more frequently.\nWhen you have logged in to SUPR, there will be a list of options in the panel on the left, select ‘Resources’, scroll down to ‘Kebnekaise’, and click on ‘Go to HPC2N Local Compute 2025’ to get to the application. From there you will ‘Create a New Proposal for HPC2N Compute 2025’.\nFrom here you can apply for computing and storage projects.\n\nComputing Projects\nYou will be redirected to apply for a compute project based on the above instructions. From there, you can also apply for a small storage project if the linked storage project is not large enough for your project.\n\n\nStorage Projects\nWhen applying for a separate storage project, you will have to request the size of the project folder as well as the number of files you will be storing.\nAs a general rule of thumb:\n\nFor folder size: multiply the size of the data you are uploading by 5-7, depending on the analysis you will be doing. If the size of your files decreases with each step of your pipeline (and you remove large intermediate files during your workflow) as with variant calling for example, a factor of 5 is usually more than enough. If you are performing multiple genome alignments from de novo assemblies, for example, your file sizes don’t decrease significantly between each step of the pipeline, then you should multiply by a higher factor of 7 (or higher, depending on what you will be doing).\nFor number of files: multiply the number of files you are starting out with by 1000. If you are using Nextflow workflows, this number may have to be a bit higher (but should not exceed 5000) as the number of intermediate files produced here is higher due to parallelisation.\n\nIn short, consider the analyses you will be doing, what kind of data you are producing, and how big the files are. With these two very general rules, it should be easier to decide on these parameters when applying for projects!\nWhen your storage and compute projects have been approved, you will be able to upload data from your computer, or download from data delivery systems. If you are downloading from SciLifeLab, please see their guide.\nYour approved projects will be located under /proj/nobackup where xyz are the project identifiers provided to you by NAISS, or based on the folder name you selected when applying for the project. Upload your project data into the storage project folder. DO NOT upload your data to your user home directory as that directory is only intended for things you will use for every project and space is limited.",

As is the The Unix Shell, a self paced introduction to the unix shell and command line operations, provided by the Software Carpentries.\nIf you don’t have access to a server yet, and would like to practice on your local Windows machine, download MobaXterm and run a shell session on your Windows machine. If you are using a Mac, you will be able to follow the tutorial from the terminal that comes with your operating system.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\nTraditionally, Windows users had to connect to servers using PuTTy or a similar interface. We recommend making use of VSCode that comes with your Windows operating system (it can also be installed on machines that run Linux builds and MacOS).\nWith VSCode, you can connect to servers using ssh, install extensions supporting a variety of coding languages, write and render markdown documents, and more. VSCode makes working on servers much easier as you can have a text editor open to edit your scripts to save them directly on the server you are working on, have a file manager open for a more traditional view of the file tree, as well as having multiple terminals open simultaneously.\n\nConnecting to Uppmax servers with VSCode\n\nOpen VSCode\nctrl+shift+p\nRemote-SSH: Add new SSH Host\nFollow login instructions on Uppmax support\nAdd the info to the first .ssh file prompted\nctrl+shift+p\nRemote-SSH: Connect to Host",

For detailed info about the courses, please see the syllabus and preliminary schedule attached.\nThe aims of the courses are to:\n\nfamiliarize the participants with advanced RNA-Seq data analysis methodologies and how biological knowledge can be gained from these by illustrating different analyses approaches\nallow the participants to acquire computational competences about latest RNA-Seq analytical approaches and related statistical methods\nexpose the participants to modern computing technologies, as the computer hands-on of the course will be performed using cloud computing resources\ndevelop the participants’ awareness to critically reflect onto RNA-Seq analysis strengths and weaknesses\nenable participants to perform the analysis of their own data (in stance of the exemplary dataset otherwise available) (course II)\n\nThe second course is a follow-up for attendees to apply the knowledge gained from the first course on their own data.\nThe courses will be conducted online only. However, if students wish so, they can organise themselves in groups and join using one of the teaching facilities available at SLU.\nThe maximum number of participants is 20. PhD students will be prioritised, but admission will be on a first-come, first-served basis, provided that the minimal requirements are met. Application deadline: September 13th.\nTo register, follow this link.\nIf you have any question, please contact the course leaders (nicolas.delhomme@slu.se, amrei.binzer.panchal@slu.se) or the slack channel #organism-biology-research-school-rna-seq-course of the slubi-workspace.slack.com workspace.\n\nc"

    "text": "Applying for projects at Dardel\nHere is the link to the official documentation on how to get access to Dardel.\nThe following is a small rundown of this information based on our experience.\nMore often than not, small compute and small storage projects are enough for the bioinformatics projects we see at SLU. You must apply for a storage project alongside a compute project if you are planning to do any analyses.\nThe administrators at NAISS approve projects at least once a month, but often more frequently.\nWhen you have logged in to SUPR, there will be a list of options in the panel on the left, select ‘Proposals’ to see your proposals, scroll down to ‘Rounds and ’Resources’, and click on ‘Go to Rounds’ to get to the application.\nFrom here you can apply for computing and storage projects.\n\nComputing Projects\nSelect Compute Rounds followed by NAISS Small Compute\nYou will then select Create New Proposal for NAISS Small Compute 2025\nWe generally recommend asking for 2 or 3 x1000 core hours per month. This can always be increased later if you realise that you exceed this boundary, but that is quite rare.\n\n\nStorage Projects\nSelect Go to Storage Rounds followed by NAISS Small Storage\nHere you will have to request the size of the project folder as well as the number of files you will be storing.\nAs a general rule of thumb:\n\nFor folder size: multiply the size of the data you are uploading by 5-7, depending on the analysis you will be doing. If the size of your files decreases with each step of your pipeline (and you remove large intermediate files during your workflow) as with variant calling for example, a factor of 5 is usually more than enough. If you are performing multiple genome alignments from de novo assemblies, for example, your file sizes don’t decrease significantly between each step of the pipeline, then you should multiply by a higher factor of 7 (or higher, depending on what you will be doing).\nFor number of files: multiply the number of files you are starting out with by 1000. If you are using Nextflow workflows, this number may have to be a bit higher (but should not exceed 5000) as the number of intermediate files produced here is higher due to parallelisation.\n\nIn short, consider the analyses you will be doing, what kind of data you are producing, and how big the files are. With these two very general rules, it should be easier to decide on these parameters when applying for projects!\nWhen your storage and compute projects have been approved, you will be able to upload data from your computer, or download from data delivery systems. If you are downloading from SciLifeLab, please see their guide.\nYour approved projects will be located under /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/naiss202x_xy_xyz where xyz are the project identifiers provided to you by NAISS.\nAfter your storage and compute projects have been approved, you can navigate to your folder in the /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/ directory and upload your data in your storage project folder. DO NOT upload your data to your user home directory as that directory is only intended for things you will use for every project and space is limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDardel has a much stricter attitude towards number of files in your home directory than some other servers. Be very mindful of how many files you have in your home directory!",
