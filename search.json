Big-data requires special processing pipelines and sophisticated statistical methods and analysis tools than those that have been traditionally employed. A number of independent projects at the Nordic institutes address these needs individually, but a collective effort at the region-level can help to increase the overall competitiveness, and to ensure the sustainability of Nordic agriculture. These efforts should include also a proper training of agricultural data scientists, which is becoming more evident in today’s data-driven agricultural systems.\nMore information on NADAS and its activities here."

This base knowledge will lead to introducing two extremely useful libraries, NumPy and Matplotlib which are extremely effective in efficient manipulation and visualization of numerical data.\nPart II, on Monday the 25th of March, will have you use Python to start Training Neural Networks:\nPart I is the basis for the numerical manipulation necessary in the next workshop where we will go through theory and practice of neural network training.

Experts in the plant and animal breeding areas at our university collaborate to answer common questions: (1) how to associate phenotypes and genotypes and (2) how to accelerate marker-assisted selection in the era of high throughput genome sequencing. While plant and animal populations are intrinsically different, quantitative genetics principles and association mapping methods rely on the same theoretical basis. Along the three weeks of this course, students from all the faculties across campuses will be able to review basic principles of association mapping, study in detail the bioinformatic methods today available, and do extensive hands-on work both on pre-designed examples or using their own data sets.\nMore information here."
