A number of independent projects at the Nordic institutes address these needs individually, but a collective effort at the region-level can help to increase the overall competitiveness, and to ensure the sustainability of Nordic agriculture.

    "text": "Appyling for projects at UPPMAX\nFor an extensive guide of how to start with UPPMAX have a look at their getting started guide.\nThe following is a small rundown of this information based on our experience.\nMore often than not, small compute and small storage projects are enough for the bioinformatics projects we see at SLU. You must apply for a storage project alongside a compute project if you are planning to do any analyses.\nThe administrators at NAISS approve projects at least once a month, but often more frequently.\nWhen you have logged in to SUPR, there will be a list of options in the panel on the left, select ‘Proposals’ to see your proposals, scroll down to ‘Rounds and ’Resources’, and click on ‘Go to Rounds’ to get to the application.\nFrom here you can apply for computing and storage projects.\n\nComputing Projects\nSelect Compute Rounds followed by NAISS Small Compute\nYou will then select Create New Proposal for NAISS Small Compute 2024\nWe generally recommend asking for 2 or 3 x1000 core hours per month. This can always be increased later if you realise that you exceed this boundary, but that is quite rare.\n\n\nStorage Projects\nSelect Go to Storage Rounds followed by NAISS Small Storage\nHere you will have to request the size of the project folder as well as the number of files you will be storing.\nAs a general rule of thumb:\n\nFor folder size: multiply the size of the data you are uploading by 5-7, depending on the analysis you will be doing. If the size of your files decreases with each step of your pipeline (and you remove large intermediate files during your workflow) as with variant calling for example, a factor of 5 is usually more than enough. If you are performing multiple genome alignments from de novo assemblies, for example, your file sizes don’t decrease significantly between each step of the pipeline, then you should multiply by a higher factor of 7 (or higher, depending on what you will be doing).\nFor number of files: multiply the number of files you are starting out with by 1000. If you are using Nextflow workflows, this number may have to be a bit higher (but should not exceed 5000) as the number of intermediate files produced here is higher due to parallelisation.\n\nIn short, consider the analyses you will be doing, what kind of data you are producing, and how big the files are. With these two very general rules, it should be easier to decide on these parameters when applying for projects!\nWhen your storage and compute projects have been approved, you will be able to upload data from your computer, or download from data delivery systems. If you are downloading from SciLifeLab, please see their guide.\nYour approved projects will be located under /proj/naiss202x_xy_xyz where xyz are the project identifiers provided to you by UPPMAX. Here it is important to note that your project will be called “NAISS 2024/23-xyz” on the SUPR page, but the projects follow the above naming convention on the server.\nAfter your storage and compute projects have been approved, you can navigate to your folder in the /proj/ directory and upload your data in your storage project folder. DO NOT upload your data to your user home directory as that directory is only intended for things you will use for every project and space is limited.",

We provide free consultation during the initial planning stages of your project or for addressing specific inquiries regarding best practices or optimal tools. Feel free to contact us for assistance or visit us in one of our our drop-in sessions.\n\n\nProject support\nWe also offer more intensive project support for SEK800 per hour. This support is highly individual and depends on your needs. We can run all bioinformatic analyses for you, or be a sounding board for you or your students in the progress of your project.\nIf you require dedicated bioinformatics expertise for your project, you have the option to hire a bioinformatician for a specified duration.\n\n\nEducation and training\nWe offer a range of PhD and MSc courses on a multitude of bioinformatics topics. Check our list of past and present courses to see if something fits your interest. Most of these courses are on a recurring schedule.\nAdditionally, we organize seminars and workshops, shorter hands-on sessions on a selected range of topics. Notably, we have a recuring workshop session in collaboration with SLU’s Center for Statistics, the Basic Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Series. Here we explain basic statistics concepts, or introduce useful tools and techniques.\nWe also accommodate workshop requests based on demand. If there’s a specific topic you’re interested in or if you’re organizing a course and require bioinformatics instructors, please contact us.\n\n\nAccess to our services\nWe maintain an open application process, accepting projects on a rolling basis. To express your interest, simply contact us. We will then arrange an introductory meeting with one of our experts.\nOnce the project scope and requirements are agreed upon, a contract will be drafted, signed by the project’s principal investigator, and submitted to SLUBI to initiate support.\nThroughout the support period, you’ll have direct communication with your designated expert via email and/or meetings as needed. Our coordinator will also be on hand to provide additional support if required.",
