Experts in the plant and animal breeding areas at our university collaborate to answer common questions: (1) how to associate phenotypes and genotypes and (2) how to accelerate marker-assisted selection in the era of high throughput genome sequencing. While plant and animal populations are intrinsically different, quantitative genetics principles and association mapping methods rely on the same theoretical basis. Along the three weeks of this course, students from all the faculties across campuses will be able to review basic principles of association mapping, study in detail the bioinformatic methods today available, and do extensive hands-on work both on pre-designed examples or using their own data sets.\nMore information here."

Big-data requires special processing pipelines and sophisticated statistical methods and analysis tools than those that have been traditionally employed. A number of independent projects at the Nordic institutes address these needs individually, but a collective effort at the region-level can help to increase the overall competitiveness, and to ensure the sustainability of Nordic agriculture. These efforts should include also a proper training of agricultural data scientists, which is becoming more evident in today’s data-driven agricultural systems.\nMore information on NADAS and its activities here."

In comparison to micro-array-based methods, NGS has unleashed an almost unlimited power to perform gene expression analysis, for a similar price and with faster, more comprehensive, more efficient and more reproducible characteristics. Rapidly, the data generation rate has exceeded the analytical capabilities and data analysis has become the major bottleneck in gene expression studies. This course, aimed at advanced students, has the objective to help addressing this problem by (i) helping participants critically assess the challenges faced in the HTS field, (ii) developing efficient communication skill with bioinformatician, and (iii) training students in analyzing HTS data."
