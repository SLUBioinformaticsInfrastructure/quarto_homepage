:::

We are running a topic-driven discussion series where Adam Fl√∂hr from the Centre for Statistics discusses the statistical magic behind some of the common methods we use, and Lizel Potgieter from SLUBI uses data to show a hands-on example of how to execute the analyses. \

All data and codes of past sessions is available at https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/Three_Bees_Workshop_Series.
