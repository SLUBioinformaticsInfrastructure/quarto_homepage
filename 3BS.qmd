<br>
SLUBI and the SLU Centre for Statistics are bringing you a new series focused on R and applications in bioinformatics.\
  <b>Mondays in even weeks, 09:45 </b>\
  <b>Campus Alnarp, Horticum </b>\
  <b>or via [Zoom](https://slu-se.zoom.us/j/69486568642) (Password: 410 410) </b>

:::

We are starting a topic-driven discussion series where Adam Fl√∂hr from the Centre for Statistics will discuss the statistical magic behind some of the common methods we use, and Lizel Potgieter from SLUBI will use data to show a hands-on example of how to execute the analyses. \

All data and codes will be available at https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/Three_Bees_Workshop_Series.

**Program** \


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library("xlsx")
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
table <- read.xlsx("3bees_schedule.xlsx", 1, header=TRUE)
dt <- table[1:9,1:2]
dt %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
```

<br>
We want to serve the SLU bioinformatics communities, so the floor to topic suggestions is open: 

Please fill out [this questionnaire](https://forms.gle/4juDXf3tK8dSxmpe8) to decide what you would like to hear (more) about.
