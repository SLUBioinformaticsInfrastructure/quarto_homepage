SLUBI and the SLU Centre for Statistics are bringing you a workshop series focused on R and applications in bioinformatics.\
<b>Mondays in even weeks, 09:45 </b>\
<b>Campus Alnarp or Ultuna </b>\
<b>and always via [Zoom](https://slu-se.zoom.us/j/69486568642) (Password: 410 410) </b>

:::

We are running a topic-driven discussion series where Adam Fl√∂hr from the Centre for Statistics discusses the statistical magic behind some of the common methods we use, and bioinformaticians from SLUBI use data to show a hands-on example of how to execute the analyses. \

All data and codes of past sessions is available at our [github page](https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/Three_Bees_Workshop_Series).
