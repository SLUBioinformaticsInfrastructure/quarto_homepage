SLUBI and the SLU Centre for Statistics are bringing you a new series focused on R and applications in bioinformatics.\
  <b>Mondays in even weeks, 09:45 </b>\
  <b>Campus Alnarp, Horticum </b>\
  <b>or via [Zoom](https://slu-se.zoom.us/j/69486568642) (Password: 410 410) </b>

:::

We are starting a topic-driven discussion series where Adam Fl√∂hr from the Centre for Statistics will discuss the statistical magic behind some of the common methods we use, and Lizel Potgieter from SLUBI will use data to show a hands-on example of how to execute the analyses. \

All data and codes will be available at https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/Three_Bees_Workshop_Series.
