# Consultation
The support we offer is based on your needs. We offer **free consultation** in the planning stages of your project, or if you have some specific questions about best practices or optimal tools. We are here for your questions, for example in our [drop-in](dropin-qmd).

# Project support
We also offer more intensive **project support** for SEK800 per hour. There, we only count time when our experts are actively working with your project (including meetings), compute-time is free. This support is highly individual and depends on your needs. We can run all bioinformatic analyses for you, or be a sounding board for you or your students in the progress of your project. 

If you need a bioinformatician for your project you can **hire a bioinformatician** for a certain time.

# Education and training
We offer a range of PhD and MSc **courses** on a multitude of bioinformatics topics. Check our list of [past and present courses](courses.qmd) to see if something fits your interest. Most of these courses are on a recurring schedule. 

We also organize **seminars and workshops**, shorter hands-on sessions on a selected range of topics. Notably, we have a recuring workshop session in collaboration with SLU's Center for Statistics, the [Basic Biostatistics & Bioinformatics](3BS.qmd) Series. Here we explain basic statistics concepts, or introduce handy tools and techniques. 

 We also can arrange workshops on demand. So if there is a topic you are interested in, or you are organzing a course and need someone to teach the bioinformatics part, please [contact](contact.qmd) us. 

# Access to our services
We have **no application deadlines**, and projects are accepted continuously. 

If you are interested, please [contact us](contact.qmd). We will then set up a first meeting with one of our experts. Once you have agreed with the expert to what analyses should be performed, a contract will be written. Once the contract is agreed upon, signed by the project's PI, and submitted to SLUBI, the support can start. 

During the support you will communicate with the expert via email and/or meetings as necessary. Our coordinator will also be available to support you if needed.
